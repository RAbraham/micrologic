# micro-logic {#micro-logic}

An idiomatic, obsessivly well-documented Clojure implementation of
microKanren:
http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf

microLogic can be thought of as the core.logic parallel of
microKanren. It has simplified verisons of some of the same concepts,
namely the extensible unifier. By reading the code and documentation,
you can understand more about how core.logic works.

It may also be a suitable base for experimental logic programming
ideas, because of its simplicity.


## Usage {#usage}

{% endhighlight %}clojure
(ns my.ns
  [micro-logic.protocols :refer :all]
  [micro-logic.core :refer :all])

(run 1 [q] (conde [(===


## Differences from microKanren

Polymorphic dispatch via protocols is used in place of `(cond)` with
type checks, where possible.

Clojure-native datatypes are used where appropriate
- The substitution map is a clojure map instead of an alist
- There is an LVar defrecrord, instead of using a vector of c
- We have an explicit StreamNode data type, rather building on the
  built-in list type
- Clojure doesn't allow improper lists; LListCell is a linked list
  which does.

Many names have changed to be more clojure-like:

uKanren | microLogic
--------------------
mplus   | merge-streams
bind    | mapcat-stream
pull    | realize-stream-head
mzero   | empty-stream
unit    | stream
Zzz     | delay-goal
conj    | lconj
disj    | ldisj
==      | ===
